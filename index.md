### What is Discord3DS?

Discord3DS is meant to be a Discord Rich Presence for Nintendo 3DS. 

Discord added **Xbox Integration** to Discord on April 24, of 2018. In the last few months, a creator known as **Tustin** created a third party program called [PlaystationDiscord](https://tusticles.com/PlayStationDiscord/) that allows you to sign into your PSN Account and display on Discord what you were playing from your PS4, PS3, and PSVita. Seeing this sparked me to try and create something Nintendo related, and let you display from one of Nintendo's consoles. This is where [Discord3DS](https://github.com/Cooljackup/Discord3DS) was created. I know some are wondering, `Why not do Nintendo Switch first?` or, `The Nintendo 3DS is dead! Move on!` I completely agree with both of these, I wanted to do Nintendo Switch first, but I don't own a Nintendo Switch as of now, I currently borrow one. I would have no means of seeing the software from the Nintendo Switch or test the program in a sortof easy way. Another issue I came by was that the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch are both very different hardware. The Nintendo 3DS has come very close to the end of its time, meaning it wont get much support now, and hacking and tearing them apart without Nintendo really doing anything is super beneficial. The Nintendo Switch on the other hand is still very much alive, and monitored, alot, and with Nintendo Switch hacking/programming coming slowly along, there isnt alot to work with yet, WHICH is why I thought this would be smart to do the Nintendo 3DS first!
