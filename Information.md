Welcome to the Information Page! Below is some info about **Discord3DS**!

### What is Discord3DS?

Discord3DS is meant to be a Discord Rich Presence for Nintendo 3DS.

### Why was Discord3DS created?

I originally wanted to create Discord3DS last year, in 2018. Although my knowledge at the time was **VERY** limited, and I did not know how to even approach this. __I am still having a hard time with this!__ ;)

Discord added **Xbox Integration** to Discord on April 24, of 2018. When this originally came out, I was facisnated by it, and started to mess around with Rich Presence, not much, but enough to do something. 

About 7-8 months later, a creator known as **Tustin** created a third party program called [PlaystationDiscord](https://tusticles.com/PlayStationDiscord/) that allows you to sign into your PSN Account and display on Discord what you were playing from your PS4, PS3, and PSVita. Seeing this absolutely made me shocked and made me realize it was possible for me to do what I want, which was to try and create something Nintendo related with Discord Presence, and let it display from one of Nintendo's consoles. This is where [Discord3DS](https://github.com/Cooljackup/Discord3DS) was created. 

I know some of you are wondering, `Why not do Nintendo Switch first?` or, `The Nintendo 3DS is dead! Move on!` I completely agree with both of these, I wanted to do Nintendo Switch first, but I don't own a Nintendo Switch as of now, I currently borrow one. I would have no means of seeing the software from the Nintendo Switch or test the program as I needed or wanted to. Another issue I came by was that the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch are **VERY** different in both hardware and act differently. The Nintendo 3DS have been both deemed dead and not taken care of anymore by the community, thinking its prolonged life has come to an end. This gives me full advantage to tamper and mess with the 3DS as much as possible, without something major happening (Highly unlikely to not happen, Nintendo loves to smack down on certain fans and destroy their projects.).

### Q/A

* **Are you ever going to make a Switch version/port?**
Honestly, I dont know how to answer this. I might, I might not. It all depends how much effort and trouble I have to go to do so.


* **Why didnt you just make it just one unified project, so 3DS and Switch together?**
Sadly, I wish I could this, but since both use very different hardware and account programming, I think its impossible to make one program out of it.


* **What else do you plan on doing with Discord3DS?**
Im hoping to aim add as much capability and functionality to as possible. Im hoping to atleast get something involved with the Friends List at some point. As of right now, just basic functionality and basic functions to get this up and running fully.


* **When is this going to get released?**
I cant set a date on this, this could be finished in a week, a month, or even a year. Its however long until I feel satisfied. 


## More Soon!
